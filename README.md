<h4 align="center">A 2-in-1 Boost for the Arc browser designed to improve YouTube's theatre mode when using light mode.
Named after going to the pictures, because that's a funny way to refer to the cinemas or dare I say, the theatre?</h4>

## Key Features

* Theme Compliant Navigation Bar 
  - Makes the top of your screen behave as it should, complying to the default light theme like god intended.

## How To Install

> If you're anything like me when I first found out about Boosts, I had no clue how to actually install them, let alone make them; yet here we are! Here's a comfy little beginner friendly guide to make it simple for you too:

**Step One** - go to <a href="https://www.youtube.com>" target="_blank">YouTube</a> and select the <a href="https://imgur.com/a5SRI3H" target="_blank">little plus icon</a> and select New Boost.

**Step Two** - From the following options presented, select Custom, A Specific Website, make sure the link is directed at YouTube and create your Boost.

**Step Three** - To set up the navigation bar modification, go to the <a href="https://imgur.com/c2Dh4nB" target="_blank">content.js tab</a> and insert the contents of the content.js file from <a href="https://github.com/lilyspad/YouTube-Pictures/blob/main/content.js" target="_blank">this page</a>.

**Step Four** - next do the same as the above, moving over to the styles.css page, where you will insert the contents of the styles.css content from <a href="https://github.com/lilyspad/YouTube-Pictures/blob/main/styles.css" target="_blank">this page.</a>

**Step Five** (*optional*) - Select the <a href="https://imgur.com/0d1j5WY" target="_blank">settings button</a> and rename the Boost to YouTube Pictures. This isn't required and won't break anything, it'll just make it look nicer in your extensions menu.

## **Notes**
> If you only want to use one or the other modification, remove the contents of the styles.css tab to bring back the black bars and vice versa for the contents.js tab to bring back the black navigation bar.

> I'm very new to these kinds of modifications and have found that for whatever reason, using extensions such as <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/improve-youtube-video-you/bnomihfieiccainjcjblhegjgglakjdd" target="_blank">Improve YouTube!</a> and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/enhancer-for-youtube/ponfpcnoihfmfllpaingbgckeeldkhle" target="_blank">Enhancer for YouTube</a> may break functionality of these boosts. No clue why, sorry.
